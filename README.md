Chatbot using NLP
Description
This project implements a simple chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with nltk, scikit-learn, and streamlit for the user interface. The chatbot is designed to recognize user input patterns and provide appropriate responses based on predefined intents.

Features
Recognizes and responds to greetings, farewells, and common user queries.
Utilizes nltk for tokenization and text preprocessing.
Uses scikit-learn for text vectorization and classification.
Provides a user-friendly interface with streamlit.
Can be expanded to include additional intents and responses.
Requirements
Ensure Python is installed (Python 3.13 recommended). Install the necessary libraries before running the chatbot:

pip install nltk scikit-learn streamlit
How It Works
The chatbot is trained on predefined intents (greetings, farewells, budgeting, etc.).
It uses TF-IDF vectorization to process and analyze user input.
Logistic Regression is used for classifying user queries.
Responses are selected randomly from predefined responses based on classification results.
Running the Chatbot
Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Run the Python script to start the chatbot:
streamlit run chatbot.py
Interact with the chatbot through the web-based interface.
Project Structure
chatbot.py - Main script containing chatbot logic and Streamlit UI.
nltk_data/ - Directory for storing downloaded nltk data.
requirements.txt - List of dependencies for easy installation.
Example Interactions
User: Hello
Bot: Hi there!

User: How can I make a budget?
Bot: A good budgeting strategy is the 50/30/20 rule...
Supported Intents
The chatbot recognizes the following intents:

Greeting: Responds to "Hi", "Hello", etc.
Goodbye: Recognizes farewells.
Thanks: Acknowledges gratitude.
About: Provides chatbot information.
Help: Offers assistance.
Age: Responds to age-related queries.
Weather: Provides basic weather information.
Budgeting: Offers budgeting advice.
Credit Score: Explains credit scores and how to check them.
Notes
The chatbot currently works with predefined responses.
Streamlit can be used to build a graphical interface for a better user experience.
Future updates may include more advanced NLP techniques and real-time API integrations.
Future Improvements
Expand the dataset with more intents and responses.
Integrate real-time data APIs (e.g., weather updates).
Improve the model using deep learning techniques.
Implement a feedback system to improve chatbot accuracy over time.
