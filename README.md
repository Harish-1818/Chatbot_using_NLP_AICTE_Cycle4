# Chatbot using NLP

## Description
This project implements a simple chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, and `streamlit` for the user interface. The chatbot is designed to recognize user input patterns and provide appropriate responses based on predefined intents.


## Features
- Recognizes and responds to greetings, farewells, and common user queries.
- Utilizes `nltk` for tokenization and text preprocessing.
- Uses `scikit-learn` for text vectorization and classification.
- Provides a user-friendly interface with `streamlit`.
- Can be expanded to include additional intents and responses.

## Requirements
Ensure Python is installed (Python 3.13 recommended). Install the necessary libraries before running the chatbot:
```sh
pip install nltk scikit-learn streamlit
```

## How It Works
1. The chatbot is trained on predefined intents (greetings, farewells, budgeting, etc.).
2. It uses TF-IDF vectorization to process and analyze user input.
3. Logistic Regression is used for classifying user queries.
4. Responses are selected randomly from predefined responses based on classification results.

## Running the Chatbot
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the Python script to start the chatbot:
```sh
streamlit run chatbot.py
```
3. Interact with the chatbot through the web-based interface.

## Project Structure
- `chatbot.py` - Main script containing chatbot logic and Streamlit UI.
- `nltk_data/` - Directory for storing downloaded `nltk` data.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies for easy installation.

## Example Interactions
```
User: Hello
Bot: Hi there!

User: How can I make a budget?
Bot: A good budgeting strategy is the 50/30/20 rule...
```

## Supported Intents
The chatbot recognizes the following intents:
- **Greeting**: Responds to "Hi", "Hello", etc.
- **Goodbye**: Recognizes farewells.
- **Thanks**: Acknowledges gratitude.
- **About**: Provides chatbot information.
- **Help**: Offers assistance.
- **Age**: Responds to age-related queries.
- **Weather**: Provides basic weather information.
- **Budgeting**: Offers budgeting advice.
- **Credit Score**: Explains credit scores and how to check them.

## Notes
- The chatbot currently works with predefined responses.
- Streamlit can be used to build a graphical interface for a better user experience.
- Future updates may include more advanced NLP techniques and real-time API integrations.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset with more intents and responses.
- Integrate real-time data APIs (e.g., weather updates).
- Improve the model using deep learning techniques.
- Implement a feedback system to improve chatbot accuracy over time.

Training for the project on Implementation of Chatbot using NLP

To run streamlit use the command as
# streamlit run chatbot.py
The above command has to be run in command prompt by navigating to the folder or using VSC terminal or Terminal of Mac. But navigating to the folder where you have script is important.
